# docs

## Scope
Project knowledge base:
- architecture decision records (ADRs)
- contributor onboarding guides
- coding standards and review policies
- subsystem ownership map

## Ownership
- **Primary owner:** Architecture Council.
- **Contributors:** every team updates docs with behavior or interface changes.

## Extension points
- Store decisions in ADR format with context, decision, and consequences.
- Keep onboarding docs task-oriented (first build, debug, test, contribution flow).
- Version coding standards and enforce them in CI/tooling over time.

## Parallel-work rules
- Significant technical changes must land with matching documentation updates.
- Deprecated guidance should be removed or marked with replacement links.
