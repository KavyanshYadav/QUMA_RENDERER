# samples

## Scope
Minimal runnable examples that demonstrate engine usage patterns.

## Ownership
- **Primary owner:** Developer Experience team.
- **Contributors:** any subsystem owner for feature demos.

## Extension points
- Keep one sample per concept (boot, window/input, render pipeline, modules, tooling).
- Prefer small, composable demos over one monolithic showcase.
- Include a short run/build instruction in each sample folder.

## Parallel-work rules
- Samples should depend only on stable engine interfaces.
- If a sample requires experimental APIs, mark it clearly and isolate it.
